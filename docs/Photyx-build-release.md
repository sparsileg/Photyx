# Photyx — Build & Release Reference

Living reference for building Photyx locally, producing installers for
Linux/Windows/macOS, and shipping releases (manually or via CI). Update
this doc whenever the build setup changes.

---

## 0. Project layout that matters for builds

Photyx is a **Cargo workspace**, not a single crate:

```
Photyx/                     <- workspace root Cargo.toml (members list only)
    Cargo.toml              <- [workspace], no [package], no version
    package.json            <- npm scripts, its own "version" field
    crates/photyx-xisf/     <- workspace member
    src-tauri/
        Cargo.toml          <- [package] version — THE version, since Issue 161
        tauri.conf.json     <- no "version" field (falls back to Cargo.toml)
        src/
    src-svelte/              <- SvelteKit frontend
    build/                   <- frontend build output (adapter-static), gitignored
```

**Important consequence:** because this is a workspace, `cargo
build`/`cargo check` — run from either the repo root or from
`src-tauri/` — resolve the workspace and put compiled output at the
**workspace root**: `Photyx/target/release/photyx`, *not*
`Photyx/src-tauri/target/...`. Keep this in mind for CI caching paths
and any script that looks for the binary.

### Three version numbers that must not be confused

| File                        | Field               | Who reads it                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`      | `[package] version` | **Source of truth.** Cargo's own build output, `getVersion()` (via Tauri's fallback), `tauri-action`'s `__VERSION__` substitution                                                             |
| `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` | `version`           | Deliberately **absent** (Issue 161) so it falls back to Cargo.toml. Do not re-add it unless you want to fork the two apart again                                                              |
| `package.json`              | `version`           | npm/Node tooling only (e.g. what `npm run tauri build`'s banner prints). Currently **not kept in sync** — cosmetic drift, harmless, but don't be surprised if it disagrees with the other two |

**SemVer only.** Cargo enforces strict SemVer on `[package] version` —
no bare suffixes like `0.11.0B`. Use a proper prerelease identifier
instead:

- `0.11.0-beta` / `0.11.0-beta.1` — beta builds
- `0.11.0-rc.1` — release candidate
- `0.11.0` — stable

**Windows MSI caveat (see §2):** the Windows Installer format only
accepts a *numeric-only* prerelease identifier (e.g. `0.11.0-1` would
be legal for MSI; `0.11.0-beta.1` is not, since `"beta"` isn't a
number). Rather than warp the version scheme for one installer format,
Photyx has dropped MSI entirely and ships NSIS only on Windows — see
§2's Windows section for the full reasoning.

---

## 1. Local development builds (no bundling)

For day-to-day iteration you almost never need a bundled installer.

**Hot-reload dev mode** (frontend + backend, auto-rebuild on save):

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

**Rust-only correctness check** (fastest signal, no codegen/link, no
bundling):

```bash
cd src-tauri && cargo check && cd ..
```

This is the right tool for "did I break the syntax" — much faster than
a full build because it skips code generation and linking entirely.

**Full compiled binary, no installer:**

```bash
npm run tauri build -- --no-bundle
./target/release/photyx
```

This runs the real `tauri build` pipeline (frontend build, Rust
release compile) but skips the platform-packaging step (`.deb`/`.exe`/
`.dmg`/etc.), so you get a runnable binary fast without producing
installers you don't need yet.

**Run the test suite** (e.g. the Issue 159 unit tests):

```bash
cd src-tauri && cargo test && cd ..
# or a single module:
cargo test analyze_frames
```

---

## 2. Platform-specific bundled builds

`tauri.conf.json`'s `bundle.targets` is an explicit list —
`["deb", "rpm", "appimage", "nsis", "app", "dmg"]` — rather than
`"all"` (see the Windows section below for why `msi` was dropped). A
plain `npm run tauri build` on any given platform still produces every
installer type *that list* supports for that platform, with no extra
flags needed once the platform's own toolchain is installed.

**You cannot meaningfully cross-compile Windows or macOS bundles from
Linux for this app.** Photyx links native C libraries (`cfitsio` via
`fitsio-sys`) and Tauri bundles are platform-native installers — both
defeat casual cross-compilation. Build Windows on a Windows machine
(or `windows-latest` CI runner) and macOS on a Mac (or a native-arch
CI runner — see the Intel note below). This is also why the GitHub
Actions workflow in §4 uses a build matrix instead of one job
cross-compiling everything.

### cfitsio linking: static on Linux/macOS, dynamic on Windows

Photyx links `cfitsio` through `fitsio-sys`. Which linking strategy
applies depends on platform, and this is enforced automatically via
per-platform dependency tables in `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` — you don't
need to do anything differently locally, but it's worth understanding
if a build ever behaves unexpectedly.

**Linux and macOS: static.** `fitsio-sys`'s `fitsio-src` + `src-cmake`
features compile `cfitsio` from source as part of the Rust build, so
the resulting binary has no runtime dependency on a system-installed
`libcfitsio`. This was adopted specifically to solve a cross-Ubuntu-
release SONAME mismatch (`libcfitsio9` on 22.04 vs `libcfitsio10t64`
on 24.04/26.04) that made Tauri's `.deb` bundler's auto-declared
dependencies wrong depending on which Ubuntu release built the package
vs which one ran it — Tauri's `.deb` bundler only ever auto-declares
webkit2gtk/gtk3/appindicator, never third-party libs like `cfitsio`,
so this had to be solved at the linking level rather than the bundler
level. Static linking also incidentally would have avoided the Windows
pkg-config gap and the macOS Intel cross-compile issue, had it been
tried on those platforms first — though Windows can't currently use it
(see below).

**Windows: dynamic (still).** CFITSIO's CMake build hardcodes
`-DUSE_PTHREADS=ON` but doesn't supply the `CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH`/
`CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH` pointing at a `pthreads-win32` install that its
own `README.win` says is required — MSVC has no native `pthread.h`.
Closing that gap would mean going deeper into `fitsio-sys` internals
than was worthwhile so far, so Windows keeps the vcpkg + pkg-config
dynamic-linking recipe described in the Windows section below.

```toml
# src-tauri/Cargo.toml
[target.'cfg(not(target_os = "windows"))'.dependencies]
fitsio-sys = { version = "...", features = ["fitsio-src", "src-cmake"] }

[target.'cfg(target_os = "windows")'.dependencies]
fitsio-sys = "..."   # dynamic, via vcpkg + pkg-config — see Windows section below
```

**Known gotcha: bzip2 duplicate symbols.** Statically-built `cfitsio`
bundles its own bzip2 stub. The `zip` crate's default feature set pulls
in `bzip2-sys`, and linking both together produces a duplicate-symbol
error at link time (`bz_internal_error`). Fixed by disabling `zip`'s
`bzip2` feature specifically:

```toml
zip = { version = "...", default-features = false, features = [...] }  # no "bzip2"
```

(Confirmed via grep that Photyx's own code has zero bzip2-zip usage, so
disabling the feature is safe.)

### Linux (primary dev platform)

System packages (Ubuntu/Debian; adjust for your distro):

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
  libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libappindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev \
  patchelf xdg-utils build-essential
```

Note: some newer Debian/Ubuntu releases have renamed
`libappindicator3-dev` to `libayatana-appindicator3-dev` — if the
package isn't found, try that name instead.

**No `libcfitsio-dev` needed.** As of the static-linking switch (see
§2's cfitsio linking section above), `fitsio-sys` compiles `cfitsio`
from source via CMake as part of the Rust build, so there's no system
`cfitsio` package to install — the workspace build handles it.
`build-essential` supplies the C compiler CMake needs; **unconfirmed
whether a system `cmake` package is also required** on a clean
machine — CI runners ship it preinstalled, so this hasn't been
directly tested on a bare local machine. If a fresh Linux build fails
looking for `cmake`, `sudo apt-get install -y cmake` is the likely
fix.

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

Produces a `.deb`, an `.rpm`, and an `.AppImage` under
`target/release/bundle/` (workspace root — see §0). RPM bundling is
native to `tauri-bundler` (no system `rpmbuild` needed); confirmed
working in CI as of this writing, taking no extra time over the `.deb`
build.

### Windows

Needs: Visual Studio Build Tools (MSVC toolchain), and `cfitsio` via
vcpkg — matching your existing per-session vcpkg setup (`J:\vcpkg`).

```powershell
# One-time (or per session, per your existing notes):
vcpkg install cfitsio

npm run tauri build
```

Produces an **NSIS `.exe` installer only** under
`target/release/bundle/nsis/`.

**Why not MSI too:** `fitsio-sys`'s build script only ever probes via
the `pkg-config` binary — it has no native vcpkg-rs integration on
MSVC (an open, unimplemented upstream request:
github.com/simonrw/rust-fitsio/issues/178). So a working Windows build
needs `pkg-config.exe` present and pointed at wherever vcpkg generated
`cfitsio`'s `.pc` file — confirmed in CI via Chocolatey's
`pkgconfiglite` package plus an explicit `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`:

```powershell
choco install pkgconfiglite -y
$env:PKG_CONFIG_PATH = "C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\lib\pkgconfig"
```

Separately, WiX (Tauri's MSI bundler) only accepts a *numeric-only*
prerelease identifier in the version string — `0.11.0-beta.1` fails
with `optional pre-release identifier in app version must be
numeric-only`. Rather than change the version scheme project-wide just
for one Windows installer format, `tauri.conf.json`'s `bundle.targets`
drops `msi` entirely (§0). NSIS has no such restriction and is a
common, legitimate installer format on its own.

If you want MSI back later, the tradeoff is real: either switch the
whole project's prerelease scheme to numeric-only tags (`0.11.0-1`
instead of `0.11.0-beta.1`, losing the readable label), or special-case
the version string passed to the MSI bundler specifically — not
attempted here.

### macOS

Needs: Xcode Command Line Tools. `cfitsio` itself no longer needs to be
installed via Homebrew or vcpkg — as of the static-linking switch (see
§2's cfitsio linking section above), `fitsio-sys` compiles `cfitsio`
from source via CMake as part of the Rust build.

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

Produces a `.app` bundle and `.dmg` under `target/release/bundle/`.

**Apple Silicon vs Intel:** by default this builds for the host
architecture only. To build both and ship separately (matching what
the GitHub Actions matrix in §4 does):

```bash
npm run tauri build -- --target aarch64-apple-darwin   # Apple Silicon
npm run tauri build -- --target x86_64-apple-darwin     # Intel
```

**Important:** the second command above only works if you're actually
*on* Intel hardware (or a real Intel VM). Cross-targeting x86_64 from
an Apple Silicon Mac is a genuine cross-compile for `fitsio-sys`'s C
dependency — Homebrew's `cfitsio` is architecture-native to whatever
machine installed it, so `pkg-config` correctly refuses to link an
arm64 library into an x86_64 binary. This bit the CI workflow directly
(see §4's `macos-15-intel` matrix entry) and applies identically to a
local build attempt. There's no universal-binary flag built into
`tauri build` either way — the two targets always ship as separate
`.dmg`s.

---

## 3. Delivering releases on GitHub

Releases are built on **git tags**. `gh` (which you already use for
issues) is the fastest way to cut one, matching the tooling you
already have.

### Tag/version conventions

- Stable: `v0.11.0` (tag) ↔ `0.11.0` (Cargo.toml)
- Beta: `${TAG_NAME}` ↔ `0.11.0-beta.1`
- Release candidate: `v0.11.0-rc.1` ↔ `0.11.0-rc.1`

Keep the tag and `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`'s version in agreement — bump
Cargo.toml first, commit, *then* tag.

### Creating a release manually

```bash
# Must execute from the repo root
cd ~/github/Photyx

# Bump the version first
#   edit src-tauri/Cargo.toml -> version = "0.11.0-beta.1"
git add src-tauri/Cargo.toml
git commit -m "Bump version to 0.11.0-beta.1"
git push

# Tag + release in one step (gh creates the tag if it doesn't exist)
gh release create ${TAG_NAME} \
  --title "${TAG_NAME}" \
  ----generate-notes \
  --prerelease
```

`--prerelease` is what marks it as beta/RC rather than a stable
"Latest release" — do this for every beta and RC build. Drop the flag
only for an actual stable release (see §5).

**Attaching built installers** so testers can download and run
directly — append file paths after the flags:

```bash
gh release create ${TAG_NAME} \
  --title "${TAG_NAME}" \
  --notes "Beta build for external testing" \
  --prerelease \
  target/release/bundle/deb/photyx_${TAG_NAME}_amd64.deb \
  target/release/bundle/appimage/photyx_${TAG_NAME}_amd64.AppImage
```

**Auto-generated notes** instead of writing them by hand (summarizes
merged PRs/commits since the last tag):

```bash
gh release create ${TAG_NAME} --prerelease --generate-notes
```

**Draft first, publish later** (useful if you want to review before
testers see it):

```bash
gh release create ${TAG_NAME} --prerelease --draft --notes "..."
# later, once ready:
gh release edit ${TAG_NAME} --draft=false
```

**Web UI equivalent**, if you'd rather click through: repo →
**Releases** (right sidebar) → **Draft a new release** → pick/create
the tag → title/notes → check **"Set as a pre-release"** for beta/RC →
drag installer files into the assets area → **Publish release**.

## 4. Automating builds with GitHub Actions

("Workers" — the actual term is **runners**: GitHub-hosted VMs —
Linux, Windows, macOS — that execute your workflow's **jobs**. A
**workflow** is the YAML file; each job runs on one runner and
executes a sequence of **steps**, each of which is either a shell
command or a reusable **action**.)

The standard, officially-recommended way to build + release a Tauri
app is
[`tauri-apps/tauri-action`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-action)
— it runs `tauri build` on each platform in a matrix, creates the
GitHub release, and uploads all the platform installers to it
automatically.

### Workflow file

Save as `.github/workflows/release.yml` in your repository root.
Adjust the trigger to match how you want to cut releases — this
example triggers on pushing a version tag (`v0.11.0`,
`${TAG_NAME}`, etc.), which fits the tagging convention in §3:

```yaml
name: 'release'

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  publish-tauri:
    permissions:
      contents: write
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        include:
          - platform: 'macos-latest'   # Apple Silicon
            args: '--target aarch64-apple-darwin'
          - platform: 'macos-15-intel'   # Intel — native Intel hardware, NOT a
                                          # cross-compile from arm64. Homebrew's
                                          # cfitsio is architecture-native to
                                          # whatever runner installs it, so
                                          # cross-targeting x86_64 from an arm64
                                          # macos-latest runner fails pkg-config's
                                          # cross-compile check. GitHub retired
                                          # the old Intel runners (macos-13) in

Notes specific to this workflow:

- **`__VERSION__` substitution** reads from `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
  (since `tauri.conf.json`'s own `version` field was deliberately
  removed — Issue 161's fallback behavior applies here too, not just
  locally).
- **`prerelease` is computed from the tag name** — pushing
  `${TAG_NAME}` or `v0.11.0-rc.1` automatically marks the GitHub
  release as a pre-release; a plain `v0.11.0` doesn't. See §5 for how
  this interacts with promoting a beta to a stable release.
- **`releaseDraft: true`** — the workflow creates a draft release
  rather than publishing immediately, so you can review before testers
  see it (`gh release edit <tag> --draft=false` to publish).
- **Linux runner pinned to `ubuntu-22.04`**, not `ubuntu-latest` —
  matches current official Tauri guidance and avoids surprises when
  GitHub rolls `ubuntu-latest` forward to a new default image with
  different package names/versions available.

### Triggering it

```bash
# Bump version in Cargo.toml, commit, then:
git tag ${TAG_NAME}
git push origin ${TAG_NAME}
```

The workflow picks up the tag push automatically and does the rest.

If you have already created the tag and want to manually trigger the
action:

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml
```

### Iterating using the same tag

Sometimes there are errors on builds and you don't want to create a
new tag simply because of a configuration issue in `release.yml`, or
some other similar type of error. These are the steps to delete the
existing tag and restart the whole process using the same tag (version
number, essentially).

```bash
gh release list
# note the tag name

# delete remote tag
gh release delete ${TAG_NAME} --yes --cleanup-tag

# delete local tag
git tag -d ${TAG_NAME}

# verify
gh release list
```

If that doesn't work, go one level deeper and delete by ID:

```bash
gh api repos/${REPO_OWNER}/${REPO_NAME}/releases --jq '.[] | select(.tag_name=="'"${TAG_NAME}"'") | {id, name, tag_name, draft, prerelease}'
# note the numeric ids — there can be more than one release sharing a
# tag_name if a draft was created separately from an already-published
# release under the same name; delete every id that comes back

gh api -X DELETE repos/${REPO_OWNER}/${REPO_NAME}/releases/<id_1>
gh api -X DELETE repos/${REPO_OWNER}/${REPO_NAME}/releases/<id_2>

# clear the tag itself — both remote and local. These are independent:
# git tag -d only ever affects your local clone, never GitHub.
git push origin :refs/tags/${TAG_NAME}
git tag -d ${TAG_NAME}

# verify BEFORE re-tagging — both must come back empty
gh release list
git ls-remote --tags origin | grep ${TAG_NAME}

# re-tag from the current, correct commit and push for a fresh run
git tag ${TAG_NAME}
git push origin ${TAG_NAME}

# confirm the tag actually points where you think before waiting on the run
git rev-parse ${TAG_NAME}
git rev-parse main
```

That last pair of commands is worth treating as mandatory, not
optional — a tag can silently point at a stale commit even after
"successful"-looking delete/recreate steps if any one of them was run
out of order or against a local ref that hadn't been refreshed. Confirm
the hashes actually match before assuming a re-run will use your latest
fix.

### First-time setup gotcha

The workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN` only has **read** permissions by default
— you'll get a `Resource not accessible by integration` error
otherwise. Fix once, repo-wide: **Settings → Actions → General →
Workflow permissions → Read and write permissions**. Note that a
`GITHUB_TOKEN` is issued fresh per run using whatever this setting was
*at the moment the run started* — if a run's failure looks like this
error despite the setting already being correct, check whether that
particular run actually started before you saved the setting.

### If you outgrow this later

- **Arm Linux builds** (if ever needed): GitHub now offers
  `ubuntu-22.04-arm`/`ubuntu-24.04-arm` public runners that slot
  directly into the same matrix — no emulation needed for that
  architecture specifically.
- **Code signing** (removes "unidentified developer"/SmartScreen
  warnings on macOS/Windows): a separate, more involved setup — Tauri
  has dedicated guides for
  [macOS](https://v2.tauri.app/distribute/sign/macos/) and
  [Windows](https://v2.tauri.app/distribute/sign/windows/) signing if
  this becomes worth the overhead once beta testing wraps up.

### Downloading a release

**Via `gh` CLI** (downloads every asset from a release into your current directory):

```bash
gh release download ${TAG_NAME}
```

Or just one file, by pattern:

```bash
gh release download ${TAG_NAME} --pattern "*.deb"
```

**Via browser** — repo → **Releases** → open the release → click the
asset filename under "Assets" to download it directly.

**Via a direct link**, if you know the exact asset filename (useful
for scripting, or testing on a different machine):

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/sparsileg/Photyx/releases/download/v0.11.0-beta.1/photyx_0.11.0-beta.1_amd64.deb
```

Note this is `/releases/download/<tag>/<file>` — a *specific* version —
which is different from the `/releases/latest/download/<file>` URLs
set up in §5b. The `latest` form only resolves once a genuinely
stable, non-prerelease, non-draft release has been published; drafts
and prereleases are excluded from "latest" by design (see §5b).

**Installing what you downloaded** (Linux `.deb` example):

```bash
sudo apt install ./photyx_0.11.0-beta.1_amd64.deb
```

## 5. Promoting a pre-release to a full release

### 5a. Beta/RC → stable

The idiomatic path is to cut a **new** release under a stable version
number, not to relabel an existing beta build as stable. Reasons:

- A version string like `0.11.0-beta.3` is explicitly *not* the same
  thing as `0.11.0` in SemVer, and tools/testers that check for a
  prerelease suffix will keep treating it as one regardless of any
  flag you flip on GitHub's side.
- Relabeling an existing beta's binaries as the stable release means
  the exact bits your beta testers exercised are no longer
  traceable back to a specific beta tag — worth avoiding once you
  actually care about that history.

**Steps:**

```bash
cd ~/github/Photyx

# 1. Bump the version, dropping the prerelease suffix entirely
#    edit src-tauri/Cargo.toml -> version = "0.11.0"
git add src-tauri/Cargo.toml
git commit -m "Bump version to 0.11.0"
git push

# 2. Tag and push — no "-beta"/"-rc" in the tag this time
git tag v0.11.0
git push origin v0.11.0
```

The existing `release.yml` workflow handles the rest correctly with no
changes needed: `prerelease: ${{ contains(github.ref_name, '-beta') ||
contains(github.ref_name, '-rc') }}` evaluates to `false` for a plain
`v0.11.0` tag, so the resulting release is created as a proper stable
release (still as a draft, per `releaseDraft: true`).

**3. Publish it** — a draft is never visible to the public or reachable
via `/releases/latest` (see 5b) until published:

```bash
gh release edit v0.11.0 --draft=false
```

Once published, non-draft, and non-prerelease, this release
automatically becomes GitHub's "Latest release" (unless an even more
recent non-draft/non-prerelease release already exists — see 5b for
how to override this explicitly if needed).

**Discouraged shortcut, if you ever want it anyway:** you can directly
flip an existing beta release to non-prerelease without cutting a new
version, but this keeps the `-beta.N` string in both the tag and the
version metadata baked into the binaries, which looks confusing to
anyone downloading it later:

```bash
gh release edit v0.11.0-beta.3 --prerelease=false --draft=false --latest
```

Not recommended as your normal workflow — included here only because
it's possible, and it's better to know that explicitly than discover it
by accident.

### 5b. Stable "Latest version" download URLs per OS

GitHub provides a special, permanently-stable URL pattern for release
assets:

```
https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/releases/latest/download/<exact-filename>
```

This always resolves to whatever file with that *exact* filename
exists on GitHub's current "latest" release — defined as the most
recent published release that is **not** a draft and **not** marked
prerelease (or whatever release you've explicitly pinned with
`gh release edit <tag> --latest`). Critically, **this deliberately
excludes your betas** — since every beta/RC in this workflow is both
`draft: true` initially and always `prerelease: true`, none of them
can ever become "latest," even after publishing. That's the correct,
intended behavior: you don't want a stable-looking permanent URL
quietly starting to serve beta binaries.

**The catch:** this URL pattern requires an *exact* filename match,
but Tauri's bundlers name every artifact with the version baked in
(e.g. `photyx_0.11.0_amd64.deb`), so the filename changes on every
release. To get a genuinely non-changing per-OS URL, the workflow needs
to additionally publish a second copy of each artifact under a fixed,
version-less filename.

Add this as additional steps at the end of the `publish-tauri` job in
`release.yml`, after the existing `tauri-apps/tauri-action@v1` step:

```yaml
      - name: publish fixed-name "latest" asset (Linux)
        if: matrix.platform == 'ubuntu-22.04'
        run: |
          find target -path "*bundle/deb/*.deb" -exec cp {} photyx-linux-x86_64.deb \;
          find target -path "*bundle/rpm/*.rpm" -exec cp {} photyx-linux-x86_64.rpm \;
          find target -path "*bundle/appimage/*.AppImage" -exec cp {} photyx-linux-x86_64.AppImage \;
          gh release upload ${{ github.ref_name }} \
            photyx-linux-x86_64.deb photyx-linux-x86_64.rpm photyx-linux-x86_64.AppImage \
            --clobber
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: publish fixed-name "latest" asset (Windows)
        if: matrix.platform == 'windows-latest'
        shell: pwsh
        run: |
          $exe = Get-ChildItem -Path target -Recurse -Filter *.exe |
            Where-Object { $_.FullName -like "*bundle*nsis*" } |
            Select-Object -First 1
          Copy-Item $exe.FullName photyx-windows-x86_64.exe
          gh release upload ${{ github.ref_name }} photyx-windows-x86_64.exe --clobber
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: publish fixed-name "latest" asset (macOS)
        if: matrix.platform == 'macos-latest' || matrix.platform == 'macos-15-intel'
        run: |
          ARCH_NAME="${{ matrix.platform == 'macos-latest' && 'arm64' || 'x86_64' }}"
          find target -path "*bundle/dmg/*.dmg" -exec cp {} "photyx-macos-${ARCH_NAME}.dmg" \;
          gh release upload ${{ github.ref_name }} "photyx-macos-${ARCH_NAME}.dmg" --clobber
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Notes on this addition:

- Uses `find`/`Get-ChildItem` with a path/extension match rather than
  hardcoded version-specific filenames, since the exact filename
  changes every release and the aarch64 macOS build path differs from
  the native `macos-15-intel` build path (`target/<triple>/release/...`
  vs `target/release/...`) — matching by pattern sidesteps needing to
  special-case that.
- `--clobber` is required — without it, `gh release upload` refuses to
  overwrite an asset that already has that filename, which every
  release after the first would hit.
- `gh` is pre-installed on all GitHub-hosted runners; `GH_TOKEN` (not
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` — that's the variable name `gh` itself looks for) is
  set the same way as `tauri-action`'s own auth.
- **The Windows NSIS output path/filename pattern here is inferred
  from Tauri's documented bundle layout, not directly confirmed
  against a successful build log as of this writing** — verify against
  the next clean Windows CI run and adjust the `Where-Object` filter if
  needed.
- This runs unconditionally on every tagged push, betas included —
  harmless, since a beta's fixed-name assets just sit inertly on a
  draft/prerelease release that `/releases/latest` will never resolve
  to anyway.

Once you've published a real stable release per 5a, these become your
permanent, never-changing per-OS download links:

```
https://github.com/sparsileg/Photyx/releases/latest/download/photyx-linux-x86_64.deb
https://github.com/sparsileg/Photyx/releases/latest/download/photyx-linux-x86_64.rpm
https://github.com/sparsileg/Photyx/releases/latest/download/photyx-linux-x86_64.AppImage
https://github.com/sparsileg/Photyx/releases/latest/download/photyx-windows-x86_64.exe
https://github.com/sparsileg/Photyx/releases/latest/download/photyx-macos-arm64.dmg
https://github.com/sparsileg/Photyx/releases/latest/download/photyx-macos-x86_64.dmg
```

Link to these from a website, README, or documentation, and they'll
always serve whatever your most recent stable release actually is —
no link updates needed on future releases.
